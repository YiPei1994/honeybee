          The bees live as they naturally would and their benefits reach more
          people. Our goal is to raise europeâ€™s bee population throughout the
          city and at the same time spread awareness among the community.
        </span>
        <span>
          Our hope is that these backyard hives will facilitate a dialogue among
          neighbours, friends, family and the community at large about the huge
          importance of bees.
